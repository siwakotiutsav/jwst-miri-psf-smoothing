# jwst_psf_smoothing
I am creating a repository for the code that I developed to use the JWST simulated PSF for smoothing the cubes and line files from MIRI instead of using a Gaussian kernel

# The code is working and almost finalized!
## Well commented code will be pushed before march!

I am too busy this February! Wait for March to get a readme and also the final version of the code! If I get enough time, I might develop this into software, too, just for fun! cheers!
